## What is REST?

Story: **Library Book System**

Imagine a library.

Every book has an ID

You request a book by its ID

Librarian gives you the book

You don’t care:

Where the book is stored

Who arranged it

How it’s managed internally

👉 You just ask and receive.

**REST in Simple Words**

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a way of designing APIs where:

Everything is treated as a resource

Each resource has a unique address (URL)

You use simple actions (HTTP methods) to work with them

REST is not a language,
REST is not a tool,
REST is a design style.

##  REST Architectural Constraints

REST is defined by **six constraints**.

If even one mandatory constraint is violated, the system is NOT RESTful.

### 1. Client–Server Constraint

**Story**: Restaurant 

You sit at the table → Client

Kitchen cooks food → Server

Waiter → API

You don’t enter the kitchen.

The kitchen doesn’t come to your table.

👉 Responsibilities are separate.

**In REST**

Client → UI, Mobile App, Automation Script,postman

Server → Business logic, Database

**Real-Time Example**

Browser sends request: GET /orders

Server fetches data and responds

Client doesn’t know:

Database type

Server language

**Why This Matters**

✔ Easy changes
✔ Faster development
✔ Better testing

### 2. Stateless Constraint(Server remembers NOTHING about previous requests)

**Story**: ATM Machine 

Every time you:

Insert card

Enter PIN

Choose option

ATM does not remember you from last visit.

Each transaction is independent.

**In REST**

Server does not remember previous requests

Every request contains all needed data

**Real time example:**
```
GET /profile
Authorization: Bearer token123
```
If token missing → access denied
Server doesn’t say:
“Hey, you logged in earlier!”

❗ Important

Login works by:

Server gives token

Client sends token every time

### 3. Cacheable Constraint

**Story**: School Notes 

You photocopy notes once.
Next time you study, you use your copy instead of going to school.

That’s caching.

**In REST**

Server tells client:

“You can reuse this response”

OR “Don’t cache this”

**Real-Time Example**

GET /products

Response header:

Cache-Control: max-age=3600

Client can reuse response for 1 hour.

**Benefits**

✔ Faster response
✔ Less server load
✔ Better performance

### 4.Uniform Interface

**Story**: TV Remote 

Power button always turns TV on/off

Volume button always controls sound

You don’t learn a new remote for every TV

**In REST**

APIs must be consistent and predictable.

| Action      | Method | URL      |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- |
| Get user    | GET    | /users/1 |
| Create user | POST   | /users   |
| Update user | PUT    | /users/1 |
| Delete user | DELETE | /users/1 |

**Why Uniform Interface Matters**

✔ Easy to understand
✔ Easy to test
✔ Easy to maintain

### 5. Layered System

**Story**: Customer Support 
```
You call customer care.

Call goes through:

Reception

Support agent

Technical team

You don’t know who fixed your issue.
```

Client cannot see whether it’s talking directly to server or not.

Intermediate layers:

API Gateway
Load balancer
Security layer
CDN

```
Client → CDN → API Gateway → Auth Service → Business Service → DB

```
Client only sees response.

**Benefits**

✔ Security
✔ Scalability
✔ Easy monitoring

### 6. Code on Demand (Optional)

Server can send executable code to client.

**Example**:

JavaScript sent to browser
Client executes logic dynamically

```
<script src="main.js"></script>
```

## REST vs SOAP
| Feature     | REST         | SOAP     |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------- |
| Style       | Architecture | Protocol |
| Format      | JSON         | XML      |
| Speed       | Fast         | Slow     |
| Flexibility | High         | Low      |
| Learning    | Easy         | Hard     |
