**“Ordering Food Using the Internet”**

Imagine you (the client) are sitting at home and ordering food using Swiggy/Zomato.

Behind the scenes, everything works using the **HTTP protocol**.

## What is HTTP?

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a communication language between:

Client → Browser / Mobile App / Postman

Server → Backend system

It defines:

How requests are sent

How responses are returned

The format of data

**HTTP is stateless**

The server forgets you the moment the response is sent.

# HTTP REQUEST STRUCTURE

When a client talks to a server, it sends an HTTP Request.

URI

Method

Headers

Body

## 1.URI (Address of the Resource)

 **Story**: Home Address

To visit a friend, you need:

House number

Street

City

Without address → you can’t reach.

### What is URI?

URI **(Uniform Resource Identifier)** is the address of a resource on the server.

```
https://api.amazon.com/products/101
```

`products` → resource

`101` → specific product

## 2. Method (What do you want to do?)

 **Story**: Talking to Shopkeeper 

“Show me this item” → GET

“Add this item” → POST

“Update quantity” → PUT

“Remove item” → DELETE

| Method | Meaning         |
| ------ | --------------- |
| GET    | Fetch data      |
| POST   | Create new data |
| PUT    | Replace data    |
| PATCH  | Partial update  |
| DELETE | Remove data     |

```
GET /users/1
```

Get user with ID 1

## 3.Headers (Extra instructions)

**Story**: Courier Instructions 

Fragile

Urgent

Handle with care

These are headers.

### What are Headers?

Headers provide **metadata** about the request.

```
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer token123
Accept: application/json
```

 Meaning:

Who you are
What format you speak
Security info

## 4. Body (Actual data — optional)

**Story**: Letter Content 

The actual message you write inside envelope.

🔹 Meaning

Body contains the data sent to the server.

**Example (Create User)**
```
POST /users
```

```
{
  "name": "John",
  "email": "john@test.com"
}
```

 GET requests usually do not have a body.

 # HTTP RESPONSE STRUCTURE

 Server sends back an HTTP Response.

Status Code

Headers

Body

## 1.Status Code (What happened?)

| Code | Meaning      |
| ---- | ------------ |
| 200  | Success      |
| 201  | Created      |
| 400  | Bad request  |
| 401  | Unauthorized |
| 403  | Forbidden    |
| 404  | Not found    |
| 500  | Server error |


## 2. Response Headers

 **Story**: Receipt Details 

Date

Amount

Payment mode

**example:**

```
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
```

## 3. Response Body

**Story**: Purchased Item 

The actual thing you receive.

```
{
  "orderId": 789,
  "status": "CONFIRMED",
  "deliveryTime": "30 mins"
}
```

# HTTP METHODS (CRUD MAPPING)

CRUD = Create, Read, Update, Delete

### GET — Read

```
GET /orders/789
```

 **Used for:**
 
Fetch data

No body

Safe & Idempotent

### POST (CREATE)

```
POST /orders

{
  "productId": 101,
  "quantity": 2
}

```

 **Used to:**

Place orders

📌 Not idempotent (repeating creates duplicates)

### PUT (FULL UPDATE)

**Story**: Replacing Old Phone 

Old phone → new phone

**example:**
```
PUT /users/101


{
  "name": "Harshitha",
  "email": "h@example.com"
}
```

Replaces entire resource

Idempotent

### PATCH (PARTIAL UPDATE)

**Story**: Changing Only Mobile Number

**example:**

```
PATCH /users/101


{
  "email": "new@example.com"
}
```

 Efficient

 ### DELETE (REMOVE)

Idempotent

### HEAD

```

Used for:

Health checks
Size validation
Caching logic

### OPTIONS
