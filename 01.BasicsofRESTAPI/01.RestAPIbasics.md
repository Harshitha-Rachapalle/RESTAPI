# What is API?

API (Application Programming Interface) is a **communication layer** that allows two software applications to talk to each other **without knowing each other’s internal details.**


 **Simple analogy**
 
Think of an API as a restaurant menu:

You (client) → place an order

Kitchen (server) → prepares food

Menu (API) → defines what you can ask for and how

You don’t enter the kitchen; you only interact through the menu.

## Real‑time example: Google Maps API

When Uber shows you route, ETA, and traffic:
```
Uber app → calls Google Maps API
Google Maps → returns location, distance, traffic data
Uber never knows Google’s internal algorithms
```

### Example: Login to an App

You open a mobile app and log in.

What really happens?
```
You enter username & password

App sends this data to a Login API

API sends request to backend

Backend validates credentials

API returns:

Success + token ✅

OR error ❌

📌 You never talk directly to the database
📌 API is the middleman
```

## Technical Example (Beginner Friendly)

Let’s say there is an API:
```
POST /login

Request Body:

{
  "username": "john",
  "password": "abc123"
}


Response:

{
  "status": "success",
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1..."
}
```

👉 This login API:

Accepts data

Processes it

Returns a response

That’s an API in action.

# Types of API

SOAP API

REST API

GraphQL API

## SOAP API (Old but Still Asked)

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a strict, **XML-based messaging protocol** used for communication between applications.

**Real‑time example:** Banking systems

Banks use SOAP because:

High security

Formal contracts

Transaction guarantees

Example scenario:
```
ATM → Calls Bank SOAP API
Request → “Get balance”
Response → XML with balance
Uses encryption, authentication
```

✅ Pros

High security
ACID compliance
Reliable transactions

❌ Cons

Heavy payload
Slower
Hard to debug
Not developer‑friendly
Not flexible for modern apps

## REST API 

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that **uses HTTP methods to interact with resources.**

REST APIs are **lightweight, fast, and scalable.**

|Method    | Meaning  |
|--------- |  ----------|
|`GET `    |Retrieve data|
|`POST`    |Create data   |
|`PUT`     |Update entire resource |
| `PATCH`   |Partial update    |
|`DELETE`  |Delete resource |


### Real‑time example: Food delivery apps

Swiggy / Zomato:

Mobile app → REST API
GET restaurants
POST order
PUT order status
JSON responses


✅ Pros

Fast & lightweight
Easy to use
Supports caching
Language independent

❌ Cons

Over‑fetching or under‑fetching data
Versioning challenges


## GraphQL API

GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, nothing more, nothing less.

GraphQL is a **query language for APIs** developed by Facebook.

The client decides exactly what data it needs.

### Story Example

Imagine ordering food 🍔:

REST → You get full meal combo

GraphQL → You choose only burger + drink

### Example
```
Request:

{
  user {
    name
    email
  }
}


Response:

{
  "name": "John",
  "email": "john@test.com"
}
```

✔ No extra fields
✔ Efficient
✔ Single endpoint

❗ Why Not Everywhere?

Complex to design

Security concerns

More logic on server

##  Quick Comparison 

| Feature     | SOAP   | REST      | GraphQL     |
| ----------- | ------ | --------- | ----------- |
| Data Format | XML    | JSON      | JSON        |
| Complexity  | High   | Low       | Medium      |
| Performance | Slow   | Fast      | Fast        |
| Usage       | Legacy | Most apps | Modern apps |
| Automation  | Hard   | Easy      | Moderate    |


# Statelessness

**Story :** Hotel Reception 

Imagine staying at a hotel.

Every time you go to the reception desk:

You give your room number

You give your ID

The receptionist does not remember you from yesterday.

Even if:

You checked in yesterday

You talked to the same person before

👉 Every interaction is independent.

That’s statelessness.

### What is Statelessness?

Statelessness means **each API request is independent**.

The server:

Does not store client state
Does not remember previous requests

Every request must contain all information needed to process it.

**State** is **stored** on the **client**, not on server.

### What If API Was Stateful?

If stateful:

Server stores session

Remembers logged-in user

Needs session cleanup

Harder to scale

This is how old web applications worked.

### Why REST APIs Are Stateless
```
✔ Easy to scale (multiple servers)
✔ No session synchronization
✔ Faster processing
✔ More reliable
Client logs in
Server returns JWT token
Client sends token with every request
```

**Scalability**
Requests can be handled by any server.

No dependency on memory.

**Reliability**

If one server fails:

Another server can continue

No session loss.

**Performance**

No session storage lookup

Less server overhead

**Simpler Architecture**

No sticky sessions

Easier load balancing
